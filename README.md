## A platform for stories
Ruby is an RPG, designed as a platform for telling stories.

Ruby's base is built using the Pathfinder SRD system, providing a comprehensive, adaptable, and well-tested RPG system. More than that, Ruby as a project is aimed at being system agnostic, meaning that users can define their own systems or use a multitude of open systems like Wizards of the Coast d20 Modern SRD.
